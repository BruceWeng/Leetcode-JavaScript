* Problem:
Choose k entries from n numbers. Make sure each number is selected with the probability of k/n

* Basic idea:
Choose 1, 2, 3, ..., k first and put them into the reservoir.
For k+1, pick it with a probability of k/(k+1), and randomly replace a number in the reservoir.
For k+i, pick it with a probability of k/(k+i), and randomly replace a number in the reservoir.
Repeat until k+i reaches n

* Proof:
For k+i, the probability that it is selected and will replace a number in the reservoir is k/(k+i)
For a number in the reservoir before (let's say X), the probability that it keeps staying in the reservoir is
P(X was in the reservoir last time) × P(X is not replaced by k+i)
= P(X was in the reservoir last time) × (1 - P(k+i is selected and replaces X))
= k/(k+i-1) × （1 - k/(k+i) × 1/k）
= k/(k+i)
When k+i reaches n, the probability of each number staying in the reservoir is k/n

* Example
Choose 3 numbers from [111, 222, 333, 444]. Make sure each number is selected with a probability of 3/4
First, choose [111, 222, 333] as the initial reservior
Then choose 444 with a probability of 3/4
For 111, it stays with a probability of
P(444 is not selected) + P(444 is selected but it replaces 222 or 333)
= 1/4 + 3/4*2/3
= 3/4
The same case with 222 and 333
Now all the numbers have the probability of 3/4 to be picked

This Problem (Possibility of all n numbers are 1/n)
This problem is the sp case where k=1 -> P(ith) = 1/(1+i)

P(1st) = 1
P(2nd) = 1/2
P(3rd) = 1/3
P(4th) = 1/4
...
P(nth) = 1/n
